# Lab Utilities

This is a collection of bash scripts, Ansible playbooks, and Terraform
configuration files that I've written.  

This repo contains a good chunk of the **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, 
**Configuration as Code (CaC)**, and **automation pipelines** that I've written 
for homelab use.

I've written all of these with the intention of using them in my homelab, which
is a Proxmox environment that hosts mostly Ubuntu Server and RHEL-compatible
operating systems (Rocky Linux, Alma Linux).  

---

Each directory contains the files for specific projects I've done.  

I have setup scripts for Samba and NFS clients/servers, deployment playbooks
for a Grafana Labs monitoring stack, K8s installer/configuration scripts,
bastion host setup scripts, and other various installer scripts.  

I also have some Terraform configurations to use with Proxmox in the
[./pve](./pve) directory.  


I also store my **Bash presentations** here under
[./prolug/bash-sg/](./prolug/bash-sg/), in the form of Bash scripts that I use
as slides.
