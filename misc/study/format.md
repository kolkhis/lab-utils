here's what I was thinking for the format of these meetings:
- Someone gives a short (informal) presentation on a topic   
- Questions/Open discussion on the topic (or related topics)  
- Post some memes  
- Move on to more personalized questions (like if someone has a script that they need help with or wants feedback on)  
- Small challenge given for the week  

The goal is not to be too formal, this format is not set in stone.  
We can go over anything at any time, the presentation topic is not all we have to talk about, it's more to say "hey, you might not know this cuz I didn't know this at first".
